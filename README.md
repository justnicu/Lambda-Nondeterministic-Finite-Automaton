# Lambda-Nondeterministic-Finite-Automaton
First project for the Formal Languages and Automatons lab.

It reads the 'input.txt' file for a description of a L-NFA and some words. For every word int the file it checks and writes to the 'output.txt' file if it is accepted by the automaton, if it is it also writes the path that it took from the start state to the end state.
